## SOLID
`SOLID` is an acronym for a set of design principles created for developing software using object-oriented languages.

The SOLID principles are designed to encourage the creation of code that is simpler, more dependable, and easier to enhance. Each letter in SOLID stands for one design principle.

When implemented correctly, this makes your code more extensible, logical, maintainable, and easier to read.

To understand SOLID principles, you must have a good understanding of how interfaces are used.

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle
`The Single Responsibility Principle requires that each class should have a singular, clearly defined purpose.
`
### 2. Open-Closed Principle
`Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) must be open for extension but closed for modification.
`
### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle
`The main idea behind the Liskov Substitution Principle is that for any class, the client should be able to use any subclass of the base class without noticing the difference between them.`


### 4. Interface Segregation Principle
`Clients should not depend on interfaces they do not use. You shouldnâ€™t force a client to implement an interface that it does not use.
`
### 5. Dependency Inversion Principle
`Dependency should be on abstractions, not on specifics.
